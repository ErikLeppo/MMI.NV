Description: 
		An off shoot of the MMIcalc library.  Needed to release these functions before the final version of MMIcalc was to be released.  Two functions that are used to calculate inputs for the Nevada Multimetric Index (MMI) for benthic macroinvertebrates created by Jacob Vander Laan at Utah State University.  The index uses predicted metric values based on site predictors (similar too a RIVPACS model).  The function metrics.predicted uses code produced by Vander Laan.  The second function, rarify, was written by John Van Sickle in 2005 while he was at USEPA in Corvallis, OR.  This function is used to produce the 300 organism subsample.  By default the random seed has been set to a fixed number so that the function gives reproducible subsamples.
